In our messes students avoid giving feedback about mess due to lack of management of feedback system, and also time tacking paper based feedback solution. So here I come up with a desktop based application to get feedback of mess from students on daily basis.
It generates overall result on daily basis as well as aggregates those results to provide weekly and monthly reports. Firstly this application will be developed as desktop application and on the success it will be improved to a mobile application so that students can give their feedback online from their mobile phones.
